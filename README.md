# CVaR Glidepaths for Chilean Pension Reform

This repo will store code experiments related to a research collaboration between **Fintual** and **Clapes UC** investigating optimal portfolio glidepaths for target date funds under Chile's new pension investment regime.

The objective of our research is to develop a decaying maximum CVaR curve restriction framework that achieves minimum replacement rate requirements for Chilean pension funds.
